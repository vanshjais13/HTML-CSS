                <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
                <p>
                    Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, whose full name was Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, was born on 15
                    October 1931 in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India, and passed away on 27 July 2015 in Shillong,
                    Meghalaya. He was an eminent Indian aerospace scientist, author, and the 11th President of India,
                    serving from 2002 to 2007. Widely known as the “Missile Man of India” for his significant
                    contributions to India’s missile development programs, Kalam played a pivotal role in the success of
                    the Agni and Prithvi missiles and was a key figure in the Pokhran-II nuclear tests conducted in
                    1998.

                    Before his presidency, he worked with India’s premier space and defense institutions—ISRO (Indian
                    Space Research Organisation) and DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation)—where he
                    earned a reputation for dedication, innovation, and leadership. As President, he was known as the
                    “People’s President” due to his humble nature, accessibility, and deep connection with the youth of
                    the country. He emphasized the importance of education, science, and youth empowerment throughout
                    his life.

                    Kalam authored several inspirational books including Wings of Fire, Ignited Minds, and India 2020,
                    which continue to motivate students and young professionals. He passed away while delivering a
                    lecture at IIM Shillong. His birthday, 15 October, is celebrated as World Students’ Day in his
                    honor. Dr. Kalam remains a symbol of simplicity, vision, and dedication to national development.
